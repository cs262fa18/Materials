Non-functional requirements:
- Usability: 
  - dark-mode (would like to implement if possible)
  - large, easy to click buttons
  - go to a screen after timing is finished for users to have a chance to edit data before saving it
- Reliability:
  - limit times users can enter after the fact (e.g. can't enter 10pm as a start time and have a finish time of 8pm the same day)
  - round recorded times to nearest minute to allow for easier calculations and more useful data (10 min 29 sec can just as easily be read as 10 min)
- Performance:
  - optimize functions/methods
  - implement database design that leads to fast queries
- Supportability:
  - ensure database is easy to update and modify when necessary
    - use views where needed and create useful indexes
